/**
 * Robust in-page anchor scrolling for the home page's lazy-loaded sections.
 *
 * The home page renders each section inside <LazySection>, which shows a short
 * fixed-height placeholder until the section scrolls near the viewport. A plain
 * `element.scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth" })` ANIMATES THROUGH those
 * placeholders on the way to a target lower down; as the smooth scroll passes
 * each one it hydrates, its real (much taller) content replaces the placeholder,
 * and the growing layout shoves the target further down — so the animation lands
 * short, parking the user on an earlier section. That is the reported
 * "About Us opens Travel Packages / Events opens Travel Packages" bug.
 *
 * This helper avoids the fly-through entirely: it JUMPS straight to the target
 * (so intermediate sections never hydrate mid-scroll) and then re-pins to the
 * target for a short window, absorbing any reflow from the one or two sections
 * within the lazy pre-load margin above it, until the position holds still.
 *
 * The jump MUST be instant. index.css sets `html { scroll-behavior: smooth }`,
 * which silently turns every plain `window.scrollTo` into an animation — i.e.
 * the very fly-through this helper exists to avoid. Each re-pin then restarted
 * the animation mid-flight and the loop declared "settled" while the page was
 * still gliding through hydrating sections, so About Us landed thousands of
 * pixels short. `jumpTo` overrides the CSS for the duration of the call.
 *
 * For a target that itself lives inside a lazy section (e.g.
 * "#travel-registration" inside TravelSection), pass `prescroll` with an anchor
 * that is always in the DOM (its wrapper, e.g. "#travel"); the helper jumps
 * there first so the section hydrates and the real target appears.
